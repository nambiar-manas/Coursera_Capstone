New York is one of the most famous citites in the world and is an iconic city in the United States. This city that has 8.4 million people(United States Census) and is an area that contains a plethora of communites, ethnicies, and cultures. Indian restaurants started opening around the 1900s in New York so these cuisines have been in New York for a long time. As an Indian American, I would like to explore Indian restaurant locations throughout New York and where new ones should open for the best business. I will attempt to answer the question \"Where should I open an Indian restaurant?\" and identify areas that have a plethora of good Indian restaurant options."
